## Getting Started

- Fork the repo, then clone to your workstation.
- Work only in a separate branch; ensure no direct pushes to main (even for maintainers).[2]
- All modules, scripts, docs, and notebooks must be safe for public consumption and free from secrets, credentials, or proprietary logic.[6][1]
- Contributions of any size are valued, including code, docs, automation, issues, and reviews.[3][11]

***

## ALN Security & Compliance Requirements

- All pull requests are subject to automated security scan and ALN policy enforcement before review or merge.[7][1]
- Every code/script submission is sanitized through ALN and j.s.f. policy filters—requests are auto-blocked if non-compliant or policy errors are found.[1]
- All actions, events, and submissions are immutably logged and auditable.
- Contributors must use the least-privilege principle: no elevation, no admin installs, always use user-scope (`-Scope CurrentUser`) for PowerShell, Python, or other environments.[1]
- Every commit must pass the following checks:
  - Static analysis (e.g., PSScriptAnalyzer, InjectionHunter if available)
  - Secret/key scan (e.g., detect-secrets or built-in secret pattern filter)
  - Policy validation (ALN gate must approve the change/file:11)
- If any required tool or module is missing/failed, block the commit by default, log the error for audit, and open an issue describing the failure.[7][1]

***

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Open a PR from your branch to `main`.
- All PRs must describe the security impact and compliance status—add a comment with details and test results (screenshots, logs, policy scan output).[6][1]
- PR merges require at least two trusted review approvals, validated by cryptographic KYC/DID signatures (where available).[7][1]
- Automated checks run on every push to the PR:
  - Security scan (no secrets, vulnerabilities, or policy violations)
  - Audit logs attach to PR for transparency.[2]
- Code must be machine-readable and documented—complex functions require markdown or inline comments explaining logic, security, and compliance guards.[3][1]
- No direct changes will be merged without passing all compliance gates and explicit review/file:11.

***

## Code/Script Security Checklist

Before submitting, verify:
- No hard-coded secrets, keys, tokens, or privileged data appear anywhere in your code, docs, or config.
- All module and script imports use user scope.
- All security scans (PSScriptAnalyzer, InjectionHunter, detect-secrets, etc.) pass without errors.[1]
- Scripts fail securely—if any module, tool, or policy is unavailable, actions are blocked, logged, and explained to the user.[7][1]
- Policy violations, suspicious patterns, or analyzer issues are reported—with guidance for remediation.

***

## Audit & Privacy Steps

- All events, changes, and merges are recorded to immutable, tamper-evident audit logs (blockchain, WORM, or cloud-based audit ledger).
- Contributors must review audit output attached to PR or CI logs.
- Policy blocks, security exceptions, and privilege errors are transparently documented and visible to maintainers and auditors for learning and system improvement.[1]

***

## License, Code of Conduct, and Contact

- Every submission agrees to the repo's MIT license and policy for responsible, privacy-respecting use.[6]
- The [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) sets expected behavior; see the linked file for details, enforcement, and reporting.
- For any questions, contact maintainers via GitHub Discussions, Issues, or email listed in the README.

***

### Contributor Safeguards

- If your PR fails a compliance or security scan, review the CI logs and provided guidance. Ask for help or clarification—maintainers guarantee timely, transparent support.[3]
- All contributions, regardless of experience or size, are welcome provided compliance, security, and audit steps are followed.[11][3]
