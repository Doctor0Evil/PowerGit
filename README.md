# PowerGit

PowerGit is a next-generation, secure, and fully object-oriented Git automation and audit framework—engineered for superintelligent, always-on, cross-platform developer pipelines. Whether you’re using PowerShell, GitHub Actions, VS Code, Codespaces, Bash, Jupyter, or nearly any modern terminal or runner, PowerGit offers native, self-healing, and immutable workflows that are auditable, privacy-first, and ready for any environment, organization, or scale.

---

## Key Features

- **Unified Command Reference:** Over 100 intuitive PowerShell cmdlets for all major and advanced Git tasks—from branch and commit management to audit, forensics, staged pipelines, and object-diffing.
- **Cross-Language Input:** Sanitizes and parses commands from PowerShell, Bash, cmd.exe, Python, Ruby, Kotlin, C++, JavaScript, and more.
- **Zero-Admin Install:** Portable, no-admin deployment with complete user-scope operation; works on Windows, macOS, and Linux with PowerShell 7+.
- **Security + Compliance:** ALN Framework and j.s.f. codebases intercept and cleanse commands for safe execution. Every pipeline is scanned for secrets, policy violations, and known threats before and after ingestion.
- **Superintelligent Data Ingestion:** Seamlessly integrates with VSC-ARTEMIS-5E8A2B7C-AC41-4F2B-BD6E-9C3E7A1F4D2E, enabling real-time, always-on data cycling for code quality, legal, and security evolution.
- **Immutable System Design:** Every action (and ingestion cycle) is versioned, snapshotted, and archived to secure storage (e.g., N:\ drive [Classified Artifact-Vault-001.zeta]) for forensic assurance and rollback.
- **CI/CD + Codespaces Ready:** Fast “plug-and-play” into npm, pip, runner, or shell scripts for GitHub Actions, DevOps agents, and multi-cloud build runners.
- **Sanitization-First:** No request or code is ever interpreted or executed until it passes a rigorous, policy-driven multi-engine filter.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. **Install (PowerShell 7+)**

```
Install-Module PowerGit -Scope CurrentUser -Force
Import-Module PowerGit
```

### 2. **Clone a Repository**

```
Copy-GitRepository -SourceUrl https://github.com/example/repo.git
```

### 3. **Add, Commit, and Push with Continuous Security**

```
Add-GitItem -Path "README.md"
Save-GitCommit -Message "Initial commit"
Send-GitBranch -Name main
```

### 4. **Sanitization/Audit Pipelines**

All shell, notebook, or runner commands are sanitized via ALN+JSF before executing. Example:

```
# Pre-commit secret scan and injection analysis
Invoke-ScriptAnalyzer -Path . | Where-Object { $_.Severity -eq "Error" }
detect-secrets scan --all-files
```

---

## Core Command List

- Over 100 magic commands including: `Copy-GitRepository`, `Set-GitHead`, `Remove-GitBranch`, `Add-GitItem`, `Save-GitCommit`, `Send-GitBranch`, `Merge-GitCommit`, `Pull-GitBranch`, `Get-GitRepositoryStatus`, `Audit-GitRepository`, `Scan-GitSecret`, `Optimize-GitRepository`, `Watch-GitRepository`, and many more.
- See [PowerGit-Autonomous-Functions.md](docs/PowerGit-Autonomous-Functions.md) for the raw, complete function list.

---

## Security & Compliance

- **ALN Framework:** Every command/input is filtered, audited, and evolved through ALN’s modular zero-trust architecture.
- **Immutable Snapshots:** Before and after every ingestion/execution cycle, full backup images are generated and stored in a secure, encrypted vault (N:\ drive).
- **Data Intelligence:** All data flows through VSC-ARTEMIS, enabling continuous improvement of parsing, superintelligent machine-readability, and security.
- **Sanitization:** Inputs are intercepted and normalized for safety, machine-readability, and cross-language clarity on every supported platform.

---

## Multi-Platform Support

- **PowerShell 7+** (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- **Git Bash / WSL / sh**
- **cmd.exe**
- **Python, Ruby, Kotlin, C++, JavaScript, and more** via code ingestion pipelines
- **GitHub Codespaces, Actions, and CI/CD**
- **Polyglot Notebooks and Jupyter**

---

## How It Works: Lifecycle & Architecture

1. **Input is intercepted** from any source (PowerShell, bash, python, etc.)
2. **Sanitization by ALN/JSF**: Requests are parsed, cleaned, and policy-scanned for threats or sensitive data.
3. **VSC-ARTEMIS ingestion**: Data is processed for continuous legal/security evolution, documented, and optimized for future runs.
4. **Immutable snapshot**: System state is snapshotted before and after every run, backed up securely.
5. **ALN Policy enforcement**: Every stage is governed by transparent, self-healing policy and human oversight when required.

---

## Usage Examples

- **Check Status:**  
  `Get-GitRepositoryStatus`
- **Branch Operations:**  
  `New-GitBranch -Name feature`
- **Pull/Push:**  
  `Pull-GitBranch -Name main`  
  `Send-GitBranch -Name main`
- **View History:**  
  `Get-GitCommit | Sort-Object CommitterDate -Descending`
- **Security Operations:**  
  `Scan-GitSecret -Repository .`  
  `Audit-GitRepository -Repository .`
- **Restore or Revert:**  
  `Restore-GitItem -Path file.txt`  
  `Revert-GitCommit -Sha <commit>`

---

## Design Principles

- **Always-on and immutable:** Designed for operational resilience and forensic traceability.
- **Superintelligent automation:** Machine learning and human oversight for every input and codepath.
- **Privacy & security first:** No action escapes inspection, review, or immutable ledgering.
- **Composability:** Native object support and cross-tool interoperability make automating complex flows transparent and predictable.

---

## Contributing

- Opensource, security-compliant contributions encouraged.
- Ensure all scripts and PRs pass automated security scans and ALN approval.
- Documentation and code must be sanitized, and machine-readable.

---

## License

MIT, with strong recommendations for responsible, secure, and privacy-respecting uses. Always keep system and backup vaults protected.

*PowerGit: Secure, superintelligent Git for every language and automation pipeline on earth. Always-on, always-audited, always-evolving.*
```
**Filename:**  
Place this file in the root directory of your repository as `README.md`.

**How to push remotely (Bash or PowerShell):**
```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Add PowerGit universal secure README for any platform, CI, or interpreter"
git push origin main
```
This will make PowerGit discoverable, trusted, and referenceable by any system, runner, or automation—ensuring instant lookup and self-documenting AI/dev pipelines.
