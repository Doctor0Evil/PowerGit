# PowerGit

PowerGit is a next-generation, secure, and fully object-oriented Git automation and audit framework‚Äîengineered for superintelligent, always-on, cross-platform developer pipelines. Whether you‚Äôre using PowerShell, GitHub Actions, VS Code, Codespaces, Bash, Jupyter, or nearly any modern terminal or runner, PowerGit offers native, self-healing, and immutable workflows that are auditable, privacy-first, and ready for any environment, organization, or scale.

---

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Unified Command Reference:** Over 100 intuitive PowerShell cmdlets for all major and advanced Git tasks‚Äîfrom branch and commit management to audit, forensics, staged pipelines, and object-diffing.
- **Cross-Language Input:** Sanitizes and parses commands from PowerShell, Bash, cmd.exe, Python, Ruby, Kotlin, C++, JavaScript, and more.
- **Zero-Admin Install:** Portable, no-admin deployment with complete user-scope operation; works on Windows, macOS, and Linux with PowerShell 7+.
- **Security + Compliance:** ALN Framework and j.s.f. codebases intercept and cleanse commands for safe execution. Every pipeline is scanned for secrets, policy violations, and known threats before and after ingestion.
- **Immutable System Design:** Every action is versioned, snapshotted, and archived to secure storage for forensic assurance and rollback.
- **CI/CD + Codespaces Ready:** Plug-and-play integration with GitHub Actions, DevOps agents, and multi-cloud build runners.
- **Sanitization-First:** No request or code is executed until it passes a rigorous, policy-driven multi-engine filter.
